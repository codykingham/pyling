    "One of the things that makes Python such an attractive option for scientific research (\"scientific\" including the human sciences!) is its rich open source library of packages that can be imported. We've already worked with `Pandas`, which is one example of such a package. A package is simply a set of Python files, or [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), that together provide functions or objects that can be used when imported into a Python script. The files contain Python functions or [classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) and can import or call each other. When we import a module, though, we don't need to see any of this. \n",
