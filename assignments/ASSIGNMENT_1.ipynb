    "## Introduction: Operationalizing Linguistic Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in the humanities we deal with subjective concepts, things which are not directly measurable. Linguistics, though, sits somewhere on the border of subjective and objective. In quantitative linguistics, we try to use objective data to clarify issues once thought to be only subjective. In doing so, we have to learn how to \"operationalize\" our research questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To operationalize means to condense a complex question into a simpler one that can be addressed with empirical data (Stefanowitsch 2010). It's possible that we lose some nuance in the process. But we also enable progress to be made within a specific niche. An accumulation of this progress eventually allows us to re-evaluate our theoretical starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for instance, the following two research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> (1) In world languages, does the verb serve as the syntactic head of the sentence?\n",
    "\n",
    "> (2) In world languages, how predictive is a verb for other arguments in a sentence?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is a largely subjective one, which linguists continue to disagree on (e.g. Croft, *Radical Construction Grammar*, 2001). There is no way to test that hypothesis with only empirical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second question, on the other hand, can be answered with some Python, linguistic annotations, and a basic knowledge of statistics. And even though the answer to that question is simpler, it still has broader implications for more subjective questions.\n",
