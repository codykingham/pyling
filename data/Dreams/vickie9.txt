There was a beautiful white castle with roses around it. There was a white, gleaming gate with glitter on it. Inside the castle the queen was beautiful. She had a diamond tiara on her head. She had silk around her neck and a long, full blue velvet dress with purple lace around it. She had a diamond necklace. She had ladies in waiting. They were kind of dressed the same, but not as richly. I was just watching this, but they seemed to be aware of my presence.
