Wendy 8-year-old friend and her brother (10 years old) were packing. Wendy's brother's bed wasn't there. There was a bunch of junk that had been under it (which is true in real life) except I found this picture of me. On the back it said, "I love Vickie." This was written by Wendy's brother. I showed Wendy. We went outside. It was sent. I thought, "Oh, my god," because I don't really like Wendy's brother.
