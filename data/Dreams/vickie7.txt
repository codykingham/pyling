Valerie, Nancy (19-year-old sister) and I were in the house alone. Nancy went outside to smoke a cigarette. This man and this lady came up to her and grabbed her arms. They held a gun to her and said, "Where's your mom's money?" We told them we don't have any money. They took out a gun. I said, "Fine, we have lots of money." Then Nancy came up to me and said, "We don't have that much money." I said, "I know. I'm tricking them." They said they would come back. Nancy left, and I was the only one there. I locked all the doors. I ran and I called for help because I knew they were going to come soon. I was scared. I thought they might kill Nancy. I was also scared that we might lose our money. I saw this guy, Mark; he was from my school. I said, "Help me!" There was this other man. Nancy and I were running outside and trying not to be seen. We ran up to this place that was a bar, and we got a drink of soda.
