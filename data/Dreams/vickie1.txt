My mom and I were in the grocery store. I went over to the free cookie area. And this guy gave me a cookie. I had seen the cookies, and they were pretend grasshoppers. I saw a little spider go by (on the cookie). I said, "Oh, I don't like this cookie." I thought it was gross. But then all these other kids came. I took the cookie. I don't know what happened after that about the cookie. The guy behind the counter gave us dolls. We did something with the dolls, and then we put them back. I walked away to where my mom was. This lady came up to me and said, "Do you want a ride someplace in the university?" I said, "No, we need a ride to family housing." I remember her in another dream in a grocery store asking that. I just walked off with my mom.
