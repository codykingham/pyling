I had this horse, and I was going to go downtown. My friend, Sally, was on the back of me on the horse. I dropped her off at the stop sign. I was trying to figure out how to go downtown. I finally got there on the horse. I saw Valerie hanging out and said, "Hop on." I had a stereo with music playing. Jim Morrison (from the Doors) was singing. This guy, who was in his fifties, said, "Can I go too?" I said, "Okay." We rode home, and when we went into my bedroom, he saw the Jim Morrison picture. He said, "I'm Jim Morrison." I was kind of excited because it was Jim Morrison. Mom was excited too. I said, "Look, it's Jim Morrison." He even sang a little song for us. Valerie was there also.
