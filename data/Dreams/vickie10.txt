I am at the bus stop waiting to go to Bonnie's (7-year-old friend) party. I feel really confused. Then I go and I'm in this water; a very small pool. I saw Charlotte (11-year-old friend) with her mother, and I say, "Hi." Then the dream goes to this guy in this office. He has a computer and there are rectangle things on the computer. He put his hand on the computer and they (the rectangle things) stuck to him. So he put them somewhere to hide them. His boss comes in. He thinks the boss saw him, and he's all nervous. The boss was mad, but didn't see. Then the boss saw this suitcase with these rectangle things in it. The boss said, "Why are these there? You're a sick man." They were really Charlotte's clothes that she was bringing to my house, and that was her father (the man with the rectangle thing). She forgot the suitcase at his office.
