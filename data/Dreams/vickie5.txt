I think my dream had my mom and my sister Valerie in it. But I didn't really see her. This guy from downtown was trying to break in. He finally opened the lock. I ran after him because he was going upstairs into my mom's room. I said, "How would you like not to be Valerie's friend. Why don't you just rob yourself?" I said, "Why don't you rob your mother?" He said he lives with this girl named Bess.
