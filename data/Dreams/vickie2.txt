This was a place where you can play with all these toys. It's kind of like Toys R Us. I lost a ball I just got, and I was really frantic. I'm walking around, and I see other balls. But I don't see the ball I lost that my mom just bought me at the store. I'm playing with all these toys a little as I go on. Finally, I just stop, and I sit there and look at these toys. This guy comes up to me and says, "Are you looking for something?" I said, "I'm looking for a ball." He took something from a bag. He said, "Is this your ball?" And I said, "Yeah, that's my ball."
