We got this new house. It was really, really big. Allison (11-year-old former neighbor, Jeb (8-year-old neighbor), and Mary (5-year-old sister of Jeb) came over. I went in this room, and they tried to trap me. But I got out and that was the end of them. I felt like √ê just go away; this is my house. We were looking through all these really nice rooms. A hospital was on top of us. We went to the store. It was one of those really, really scary stores that was supposed to be scary. The store was in our house. In the dream I was thinking, "Hey, I've seen that in another dream." And I have. Doug (sister Valerie's boyfriend) was there. He went with us. He went off into his truck and just drove away. And there's supposed to be a ghost in there.
