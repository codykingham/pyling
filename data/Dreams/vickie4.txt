I knocked on Sally's door (9-year-old friend). Her dad said that they were going out someplace, and that I could come with them. We went to this place. It was a fun place that these two girls had made up. The first thing we did was go down the slide. There's a wire in the middle and you spring up in the air. You hold onto the wire, and you go back onto the slide, and you slide down. The slide was really fun and exciting. Then there's this little house thing. It had all these nice clothes: cowboy hats, fur, sparkly things, everything you could imagine that you could dress up in. I couldn't find all of it. The dream ended when I was trying to find something to wear.
